# Simplicity Test App

This is a small React + Vite application built as a coding test.  
It demonstrates an **admin panel** for managing announcements using:

- React Router v7 â€“ routing & layout
- React Query â€“ data fetching & caching
- React Hook Form â€“ forms & validation
- React Select â€“ multi-select for categories
- React DatePicker â€“ date & time input
- TanStack Table â€“ table rendering
- Mantine â€“ UI components & layout
- @tabler/icons-react â€“ icons
- LocalStorage â€“ mock backend with persistence

## âœ¨ Features

- Sidebar layout with Mantine `AppShell`
- Announcements list with sorting by **Last update**
- Create / Edit announcement form
  - All fields are **mandatory**
  - Validation errors show as **toasts**
- Categories are stored in LocalStorage and selected with React Select
- 404 page for not found announcements or invalid routes
- Errors follow a shared `IApiError` shape (`{ code: number; message: string }`)
